# PersonFallDetectionSystem

Most of people likes living independently at home. Some activity in our daily life is prone to have some accidents, such as falls. Falls can make people in fatal conditions, even death. A prototype of fall detection system using accelerometer and gyroscope based on smartphone is presented in this project. Accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are embedded in Arduino UNO R3 device to get the result of fall detection more accurately. Automatic SMS alert will be sent to family members if someone using smartphone in fatal condition and need some help. This project also can distinguish condition of people between falls and activity daily living. Several Scenarios were executed in these project.The result showed that the proposed system could successfully record level of accuracy of the fall detection system till 93.3% in activity daily living and error detected of fall was 2%.
